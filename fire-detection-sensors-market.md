<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Detection Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired</li><li>Wireless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire detection sensors are categorized into two main types: wired and wireless. Wired sensors offer reliability and stability, connecting directly to a central control panel, making them suitable for large buildings where power supply is consistent. In contrast, wireless sensors provide greater installation flexibility, reducing the need for extensive cabling and are ideal for retrofitting or temporary setups. Both types serve the same purpose of early fire detection but cater to different installation requirements and environmental considerations.</p></p>
